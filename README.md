Customer churn is when customers leave a company’s service. For banks, losing customers reduces revenue and increases the cost of acquiring new clients.

This project analyzes customer data to identify the key factors that influence churn and helps predict which customers are most likely to leave.

Goal:
Use data analysis and machine learning to understand and predict customer churn.
